# E-Commerce Website (HTML & CSS)

## Project Overview
This project is a static e-commerce website created using HTML5 and CSS3, with minimal use of JavaScript
It demonstrates page structure, navigation, layout, and responsive design, as well as using CSS to style the webpage and create a visually striking website.
It is a project I made for my university assignment, with a fun theme around dragon toys that require water to grow.
