# E-Commerce Website (HTML & CSS)

## Project Overview
This project is a static e-commerce website created using HTML5 and CSS3.
It demonstrates page structure, navigation, layout, and responsive design.
It is a project I made for my university assignment, with a fun theme around dragon toys that require water to grow.
